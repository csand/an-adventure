<!-- TITLE: June 10th, 2018 -->

- Party walked about 100m into the forest then realized they should've asked
  around Sudbury a bit more, and turned back
- Omen immediately wanted to burn the forest down
- Lyle is still reading the Gourmet's Survey of Elluismear for more information
  about local flora and fauna
- The townhall of Sudbury has been nicknamed the Thunderdome
- Somebody, probably Daavids, performed the formal greeting dab for Kaileen, the
  town elder, and was welcomed into the village
- Lyle discarded another book from his bag, Opponents of Fire
- Opponents of Fire was just a mystical self help book
- Learned about another village in the forest literally called [Forest
  Clearing](/places/forest-clearing)
- Forest clearing is populated by [Furbolgs](/people/furbolgs)
- Party begins travelling there via a convenient ravine in the forest that keeps
  them out of sight, and isn't as slick with soap so it's easier to walk in
- Lyle grabbed yet another book, this one named Enemies and Trees, because he is
  reading up a storm
- Party rests in the ravine overnight
- During Omen's watch, they are attacked by a [Wel'lot](/monsters/wellot), but
  beat the shit out of it
- Reached Forest Clearing, whose main attractions are HairBnBs for tourist
  seeing the local mushroom farms
- Party hires a Furbolg youth to help guide them around the forest named
  [Antlas](/people/antlas)
- Attacked again by Wel'lots, this time a group of three hanging out in an elm
  tree
- Lyle lends Antlas his copy of Foreigners and Turtles
